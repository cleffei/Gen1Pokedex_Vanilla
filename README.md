## Simple Pokémon Red/Blue Version Pokédex

This is a simplistic vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript Pokédex webapp based off of the Pokédex found in the Generation I Pokémon games on Game Boy.<br>
It's qute rough and in need of fine-tuning, but I had wanted to create an app with just these three languages. I'm hoping to create an updated version that runs off of a database so I don't need all of the data contained in here!
